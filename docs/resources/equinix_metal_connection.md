# equinix_metal_connection (Resource)

Use this resource to request the creation an Interconnection asset to connect with other parties using [Equinix Fabric - software-defined interconnections](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/docs/networking/fabric/).

~> Equinix Metal connection with service_token_type `a_side` is not generally available and may not be enabled yet for your organization.

## Example Usage

### Shared Connection with a_side token - Redundant Connection from Equinix Metal to a Cloud Service Provider

```hcl
resource "equinix_metal_connection" "example" {
    name               = "tf-metal-to-azure"
    project_id         = local.project_id
    type               = "shared"
    redundancy         = "redundant"
    metro              = "sv"
    speed              = "1000Mbps"
    service_token_type = "a_side"
}

data "equinix_ecx_l2_sellerprofile" "example" {
  name                     = "Azure ExpressRoute"
  organization_global_name = "Microsoft"
}

resource "equinix_ecx_l2_connection" "example" {
  name              = "tf-metal-to-azure"
  profile_uuid      = data.equinix_ecx_l2_sellerprofile.example.uuid
  speed             = azurerm_express_route_circuit.example.bandwidth_in_mbps
  speed_unit        = "MB"
  notifications     = ["example@equinix.com"]
  service_token     = equinix_metal_connection.example.service_tokens.0.id
  seller_metro_code = "AM"
  authorization_key = azurerm_express_route_circuit.example.service_key
  named_tag         = "PRIVATE"
  secondary_connection {
    name          = "tf-metal-to-azure"-sec"
    service_token = equinix_metal_connection.example.service_tokens.1.id
  }
}
```

### Shared Connection with z_side token - Non-redundant Connection from your own Equinix Fabric Port to Equinix Metal

```hcl
resource "equinix_metal_connection" "example" {
    name               = "tf-port-to-metal"
    project_id         = local.project_id
    type               = "shared"
    redundancy         = "primary"
    metro              = "FR"
    speed              = "200Mbps"
    service_token_type = "z_side"
}

data "equinix_ecx_port" "example" {
  name = "CX-FR5-NL-Dot1q-BO-1G-PRI"
}

resource "equinix_ecx_l2_connection" "example" {
  name                = "tf-port-to-metal"
  zside_service_token = equinix_metal_connection.example.service_tokens.0.id
  speed               = "200"
  speed_unit          = "MB"
  notifications       = ["example@equinix.com"]
  seller_metro_code   = "FR"
  port_uuid           = data.equinix_ecx_port.example.id
  vlan_stag           = 1020
}
```
